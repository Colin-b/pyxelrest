    > File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Macro Settings
2. Python dependencies must be installed.
    * For Python 2 users execute the following commands from within src\main\python folder:
    
            pip install pypiwin32
            pip install -e . --trusted-host rms.gdfsuez.net --index http://rms.gdfsuez.net:8310/artifactory/api/pypi/python/simple
    * For Python 3 users the following steps must be performed:
        1. PyWin32 should be [downloaded](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pywin32)
        2. And installed thanks to the following command:
        
                pip install pywin32-220.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
        3. Finally, from an elevated command prompt, execute the following command from your python directory:
        
                python.exe Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install
        4. Project dependencies must be installed. Execute the following command from within src\main\python folder:
    
                pip install -e . --trusted-host rms.gdfsuez.net --index http://rms.gdfsuez.net:8310/artifactory/api/pypi/python3/simple
3. This step will be included in previous step, but in the meantime: XLWings default configuration for PixelRest must be installed. Execute the following command from within src\main\python folder:

        python pyxelrest_post_install.py
4. This step will be included in previous step, but in the meantime: Auto Load PyxelRest Excel Add In must be installed (a version can be found in \\XS008183\Exchange\Release.7z)
