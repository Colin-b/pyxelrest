# Accessing a REST API via formulas in a Microsoft Excel workbook

Once [PyxelRest installed](../installation/installer.md) and your [REST API configured](../configuration/rest_api_using_addin.md), you will have access to formulas within Microsoft Excel.

Formulas are grouped by categories, each REST API that you configured will expose endpoints into a specific category (the configured name of the REST API).

Each formula will be prefixed by the configured name of the REST API.
