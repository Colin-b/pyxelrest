# Installing pyxelrest

The preferred way to install `pyxelrest` `1.0.0` is to use the provided [executable installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Colin-b/pyxelrest/master/pyxelrest_installer-1.0.0.exe).

It will allow to:
 * Chose the installation directory.
 * Download and install python if required.
 * Provide a path to up to date services configuration (optional).
 * Install optional dependencies.
 * Add sample services.

This installer will also list pyxelrest as installed, so that you can uninstall it the same way you usually uninstall your other applications.

If you don't want to trust the provided executable, you can re-build it yourself by downloading NSIS and using the `pyxelrest_installer.nsi` file.

If you want more control on what is installed and how, you can still [perform a manual installation yourself](/docs/installation/custom.md).
