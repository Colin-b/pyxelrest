# Installing pyxelrest

The preferred way to install `PyxelRest` is to use the provided [executable installer](#download).

It will allow to:
 * Chose the installation directory.
 * Download and install python if required.
 * Provide a path to up to date services configuration (optional).
 * Install optional dependencies.
 * Add sample services.

This installer will also list `PyxelRest` as installed, so that you can uninstall it the same way you usually uninstall your other applications.

## Using a custom installer

If you don't want to trust the provided executable, you can re-build it yourself by downloading [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) and using the [`pyxelrest_installer.nsi`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Colin-b/pyxelrest/master/pyxelrest_installer.nsi) file.

If you want more control on what is installed and how, you can still [perform a manual installation yourself](/docs/installation/custom.md).
